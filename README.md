## Calculating project and tasks progress.

Project progress is average Task scores.

## Task Properties

-   Weight (1-10) - w
-   State - s (100)
    -   Todo - 5
    -   Progress - 80
    -   Testing - 10
    -   Complete - 5
    -   Cancelled - 0
-   Priority (low, normal, medium, high, highest) - p
-   Due Date - dd (100)

## Sub tasks

A Task with subtasks is in progress if at least one of the subtasks is in progress, and is completed only if all it's subtasks are completed.

## Task score

-   Initial score -> 1 = 1.
-   Weight Score = Score \* weight -> 1w.
-   State var = State Cumm / 100 -> s / 100
    -   If task has Subtasks. Progress is shared among subtasks.
        -   Variables
            -   Subtasks number -> n
            -   Completed subtasks -> c
        -   Task progress -> c / n \* 80
    -   progress = subtasks ? 80 : c / n \* 80
-   State Score = Weight Score / State var -> 1w \* s / 100.
-   Total Score = s / w
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

# Example Calculation

### Tasks

| Id  | Title         | Weight |     State |
| --- | :------------ | :----: | --------: |
| 1   | Learn React   |   8    | completed |
| 2   | Learn Vue     |   10   |  progress |
| 3   | Learn Svelte  |   5    |      todo |
| 4   | Learn Angular |   3    | cancelled |

<br />
<br />

### Sub Tasks

**Todo:** Would need an eloquent plan on managing task - subtask relationship, as well as assigned user.

| Id  | Title            | Weight | State     | task |
| --- | :--------------- | :----: | :-------- | ---: |
| 1   | Learn Vue UI     |   10   | completed |    2 |
| 2   | Learn Vuex       |   8    | progress  |    2 |
| 3   | Learn Vue Router |   5    | todo      |    2 |

<br />
<br />

## Calculation

Formular -> 1w \* s / 100

-   Task 1.

```js
w = 8
s = 5 + 80 + 10 + 5 = 100
result = 8 * 100 / 100 = 8
Total -> 8 / 8
```

-   Task 2.

```Js
w = 10
// Has Subtasks -> 1 Complete out of 3
s = 5 + progress = 5 + (1 / 3 * 80) = 31.7
result = 10 * 31.7 / 100 = 8
Total -> 3 / 10
```

-   Task 3.

```js
w = 5
s = 5 = 5
result = 5 * 5 / 100 = 0.25
Total -> 0.25 / 5
```

-   Task 4.

```js
/* Cancelled Task is excluded from Calculation */
```

## Average Score

```js
Progress = Total Score / Total Possible Score * 100
Total Score = 8 + 3 + 0.25 = 11.25
Total Possible Score = 8 + 10 + 5 = 23
Progress = 11.25 / 23 * 100 = 48.9%
```
